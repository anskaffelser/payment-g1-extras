This project specifies document types needed to fulfill requirements for transmission of ISO 20022 files in Norway.

== Principles

* Versioning is built into document types.
* All elements are set to optional in the XSD to allow for better support in the validation service. Make sure to inspect the documentation to find what is mandatory.
* Any future versions must be backwards compatible.
